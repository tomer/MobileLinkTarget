# Prerequisites 
* Your mobile device should have support for Air Gesture. So far, I am aware that Samsung Galaxy S4 and up does have this functionality. If you don't have a supported device nearby, you can attach a pointing device to your Android.
* A web browser that supports :hover events, such as Mozilla Firefox.

# How to use
Open this repository from your mobile device. If you are too lazy to type, you can transfer the link to your mobile device using Firefox Sync, or scan the following QR code.
